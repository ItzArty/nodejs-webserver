# Simple NodeJS webserver

This is nothing more than just a plain, simple webserver written in JavaScript, using NodeJS, utilizing the modules http, fs and child_process.

Right now, the server is not even partially done, many features and, for that matter, core functionally is still in development.
The server does support PHP files, however the functionality is very limited.

Why this - 1. No real purpose; I created this server just to educate myself
           2. Sharing my work; In case anyone is still learning, they might find this useful
           3. Perhaps actually useful?; I can imagine someone would be able to make use of this piece of crap to build upon it
